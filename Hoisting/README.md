What is hoisting ?
 Ans :
 Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code execution begins. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are actually declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
